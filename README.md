# Network-Intrusion-Detection

Using this dataset, we can classify the type of network intrusion detection based on the type of protocols, duration, server rate and type of service and few other factors that causes the issue. So, by processing the given dataset using machine learning techniques we will be able to detect the upcoming type of network intrusion and helps to analyze and fix the problem soon so that there wonâ€™t be any delay for the fix.

The dataset contains 43 different types of variables such as Duration, protocol_type, serviceflag, src_bytes, dst_bytes, land, wrong_fragment, urgent, hot, num_failed_logins, logged_in, num_compromised, root_shell, su_attempted, num_root, num_file_creations, num_shells, num_access_files, num_outbound_cmds, is_host_login, is_guest_login, count, srv_count, serror_rate, srv_serror_rate, rerror_rate, srv_rerror_rate, same_srv_rate, diff_srv_rate, srv_diff_host_rate, dst_host_count, dst_host_srv_count, dst_host_same_srv_rate, dst_host_diff_srv_rate, dst_host_same_src_port_rate, dst_host_srv_diff_host_rate, dst_host_serror_rate, dst_host_srv_serror_rate, dst_host_rerror_rate, dst_host_srv_rerror_rate, label.
